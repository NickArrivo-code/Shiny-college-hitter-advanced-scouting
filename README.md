# Shiny-college-hitter-advanced-scouting
Shiny app to evaluate, compare, and predict performance for college baseball hitters.
This app is a framework that highlights my Shiny app. I created an in-depth model that utilizes confidential statistical formulas and projections that is legally protected.
This app highlights the capability of my work in Shiny without the confidential evaluation models.

Here is a link to access the app, but will also provide screenshots in the readme.
